# 🌍 NagrikMittra – Crowdsourced Civic Issue Reporting and Resolution System  

A Smart India Hackathon 2025 project tackling **civic issue reporting** using AI-powered automation, transparency, and citizen participation.  

---

## 📌 Problem Statement
Local governments struggle to address civic issues like **potholes, broken streetlights, garbage collection delays, water leakage**, etc.  
Traditional reporting systems are slow, lack transparency, and discourage citizen participation.  

---

## 💡 Solution
**NagrikMittra** is a **crowdsourced civic issue reporting and resolution platform** that enables citizens to:  
- Report civic problems easily via mobile/web.  
- Track complaint status in real-time.  
- Benefit from AI-powered categorization, spam detection, and smart escalation.  

This system empowers **citizens + local bodies** to collaborate and improve civic infrastructure efficiently.

## 🚀 Key Features
- **Automatic Categorization** → AI tags complaints into departments.  
- **Urgency Detection** → High-priority issues (like water leakage, accidents) highlighted first.  
- **Spam & Duplicate Control** → AI removes fake or repeated complaints.  
- **Community Verification** → Citizens can upvote/verify reported issues.  
- **Smart Escalation** → If issues are unresolved, system auto-escalates to higher authorities.  
- **AI Insights Dashboard** → Analytics for government officials to see trends, hotspots, and performance.  
- **Real-time Tracking** → Citizens stay updated on issue progress.

## 🏗️ Technical Approach
### **Frontend**
- React / React Native  
- Tailwind CSS for UI  
- Mobile-first design for easy adoption  

### **Backend**
- Node.js + Express.js  
- MongoDB for data storage  
- JWT Authentication & Middleware  
- Firebase Admin SDK for notifications  
- Twilio SMS & HuggingFace APIs (Text-to-Speech, OCR)  

### **AI & ML**
- Complaint classification  
- Duplicate & spam detection  
- Urgency detection models  

### **Deployment**
- AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda) for scalability  
- CI/CD pipeline for continuous updates  

---

## 🌟 Impact & Benefits

- **Empowers citizens** to actively improve their neighborhoods.  
- **Saves municipal budgets** via preventive maintenance.  
- **Faster problem resolution** with smart department assignment.  
- **Improves governance transparency** & citizen trust.  
- **Scalable** across towns, cities, and even states.  

---

### 🔎 How it Works
- **Users** report issues → platform categorizes & processes them.  
- **Main Admin** gets escalations and monitors system-wide.  
- **Sub-Admins** manage regional issues.  
- **Block Admins** oversee local complaints.  
- **Departments** execute and resolve tasks.  
- **Platform** keeps syncing updates back to users for transparency.
